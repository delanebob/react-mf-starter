# React Module Federation Starter

This project is designed to be a starter for using:

- Webpack 5 (with module federation)
- React
- Typescript

The structure of the project is a monorepo that has a app shell under the shell folder.
This app shell will be used to join all the modules together using the module federation plugin.

## Todo
- See how to implement and piece together all apps in production.
- Implement Typescript [like this](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/tree/master/typescript)
